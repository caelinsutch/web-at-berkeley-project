# Web@Berkeley Project

## Stack Overview
- GatsbyJS - Speed, Speed, and Speed
- SEO with Helmet - Make the marketing team happy
- Smart Image rendering with `image-sharp`
- JSON for Data - As per the specs
- React Styled Components - Styled components are love and life
- Typescript - Types make everything easier

### Things I didn't include
- Making a top level component for the title, upvotes/downvotes, and content for both pages that can switch the layout around - I find to be less clean as a project grows
- Testing - Honestly way out of scope of this project

### Why not normal React, Angular or Vue?

Although those are all great frameworks, GatsbyJS generates static websites, which are far faster than any of the solutions mentioned above. That being said, for a real social media platform where I wasn't pulling in data like this, Next.JS or some other SSR React framework would be better.
